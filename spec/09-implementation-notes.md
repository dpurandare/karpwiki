# 09 — Implementation Notes (Design Decisions)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

`techfeasibility.md` (working doc, not part of this spec) flagged a set of implementation-
readiness gaps in `00`–`08`. Most of those are genuinely org/runtime decisions (NFR targets,
retention policy, relevance test-set ownership) and stay as flagged placeholders. This document
addresses the remaining subset — questions concrete enough to answer now, in the same spirit as
`08`'s reference-implementation choices.

Unlike `08` (which only picks libraries for roles `00`–`07` already define), a couple of the
decisions below imply a small addition to `00`–`07`'s conceptual data model. Each item below
notes its **spec touch-point** where relevant — these are optional follow-up edits to `01`/`02`,
not applied by this document.

## 2. Decisions at a Glance

| Concern | Spec reference | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline-state storage | [03](03-ingestion-and-review-workflows.md) §1, [06](06-api-mcp-and-scaling.md) §1 | New `raw_source.pipeline_state` field — denormalized current-state pointer, mirrors `wiki_page.current_version_id` |
| Connector execution model | [03](03-ingestion-and-review-workflows.md) §2, [05](05-admin-backend-and-maintenance.md) §7, [01](01-architecture-and-data-model.md) §1 | Dedicated lightweight "connector polling" worker pool; default = scheduled poll + diff-against-last-sync, creates a normal `raw_source` on change |
| MCP on-behalf-of delegation | [06](06-api-mcp-and-scaling.md) §2–3 | Dual-identity request: agent's own AuthN + `acting_as: user:<id>` claim, AuthZ-checked against both principals |
| `SCHEMA.md` example | [01](01-architecture-and-data-model.md) §7 | Concrete template with starting threshold defaults (§6 below) |
| `diff_ref` format | [01](01-architecture-and-data-model.md) §5, [02](02-storage-and-indexing.md) §3 | Computed-on-write unified diff, stored in Object Store at `/{workspace_id}/diffs/{version_id}.diff` |

## 3. Pipeline-State Storage

`03` §1 defines a 9-state ingestion pipeline (`submitted → classifying → classified →
duplicate_check → ... → ingested|error|rejected`). `02` §3's `raw_source.status`
(`active|superseded|archived|rejected`) is a *lifecycle/retention* axis — a different concept —
so the pipeline-progress axis needs its own home.

**Decision**: add `raw_source.pipeline_state` (the 9-value enum from `03` §1), maintained as a
denormalized "current state" pointer updated atomically alongside each `ingestion_log` append
(`02` §5) — the same "current pointer + full append-only history" pattern `02` §3 already uses
for `wiki_page.current_version_id` / `page_version`. `ingestion_log` remains the system of record
for history; `pipeline_state` is what `06` §1's `sources/{id}` "get status" reads directly,
avoiding a log-table scan on a frequently-polled endpoint (`06` §2: `wiki_get_source_status`
"typically polled after `wiki_submit`").

With this field, `03` §6 step 7 reads as: *set `raw_source.pipeline_state = ingested`;
`raw_source.status` remains `active`* — consistent with the wording already fixed in `03` §6.

**Spec touch-point**: `02` §3, `raw_source` row gains `pipeline_state` (9-value enum, `03` §1).

## 4. Connector Execution Model

`03` §2 says connectors "discover new/changed content and submit it the same way" as end users;
`05` §7 covers *configuring* connectors (schedule, credentials, ingestion policy) but not *how a
run executes*.

**Decision**: connectors get their own lightweight, IO-bound worker pool — "connector polling" —
alongside the existing per-job-type pools (`06` §4: classification, curation/ingest, indexing,
maintenance advisor). On each scheduled run (per-connector interval, `05` §7), the pool:

1. Fetches the connector's current state listing (commit SHAs, page IDs + modified timestamps,
   etc. — connector-type-specific).
2. Diffs against the last-sync state stored for that connector (a small per-connector cursor,
   not a new core table).
3. For each new/changed item, creates a `raw_source` record (`submitted`,
   `submitted_by=connector:<connector_id>`) exactly as if a user uploaded it.

From step 3 onward the item is indistinguishable from any other submission — classification,
dedup, and ingestion (`03` §3–7) proceed unchanged. This keeps "connectors are just another
submission source" (`03` §2) literally true at the execution level, and requires no new pipeline
states or review-item kinds.

Polling vs. webhook: polling is the default (matches `05` §7's "schedule/refresh interval").
Webhook-triggered connectors (e.g., a Git push webhook) are an additive optimization that
short-circuits step 1–2 for that one item — same step 3 onward.

**Roadmap note**: `07` §6 Phase 2 ("Multi-workspace + taxonomy routing") is a natural place to add
a "Connector framework" deliverable, since connector-routed content depends on the taxonomy being
in place.

## 5. MCP On-Behalf-Of Delegation

`06` §2 says `wiki_submit` "lets an agent submit a document on a user's behalf," but `06` §3's
auth table only covers direct principals (end user via SSO, API/MCP client via API
key/OAuth client-credentials) — not delegation.

**Decision**: an on-behalf-of `wiki_submit` call carries two identities:

- **The calling agent's own credential** — authenticated normally (API key / OAuth
  client-credentials, `06` §3).
- **An `acting_as: user:<id>` claim** identifying the end user being represented.

AuthZ requires **both**: the agent's own grant must include `contributor` on the target
workspace, *and* the `acting_as` user must independently have `contributor` on that workspace —
whichever is more restrictive applies. This prevents an agent from using its own broader access
to submit "as" a user who couldn't have submitted there themselves.

On success: `raw_source.submitted_by = user:<id>` (the represented user — `02` §3's existing
enum, unchanged) and any resulting `page_version.author = user:<id>` (`01` §5, unchanged). The
calling agent's own identity is recorded in the `ingestion_log` entry's metadata for audit —
no new core field required.

**Spec touch-point**: none to `01`/`02`'s enums. `06` §3 could gain a one-line note describing
this dual-identity check.

## 6. `SCHEMA.md` Example Template

`01` §7 describes `SCHEMA.md`'s contents conceptually but gives no example or starting defaults.
Below is an illustrative template — starting points to tune per workspace, not mandated values:

```yaml
workspace_id: eng-docs
document_types:
  - eng.design-doc
  - eng.runbook

page_conventions:
  required_tags_min: 2          # global default per 01 §6
  additional_required_tags: [team]   # workspace-specific addition

curator:
  tone: concise, engineering-focused
  concept_vs_entity: >
    entity = a named system, service, tool, or vendor;
    concept = a pattern, practice, or methodology discussed across sources.

ingestion_policy: gated         # auto | gated, per 03 §7

thresholds:
  staleness:
    high_traffic_days: 90       # re-check sooner for frequently-queried pages (05 §2)
    low_traffic_days: 365
  dedup:
    near_duplicate_score: 0.85  # FTS "more like this" score, normalized 0-1 (03 §4)

retention:
  superseded_source_days: 180   # before Superseded-Source Detector proposes prune (05 §2)
  page_version_max_count: 50    # before older versions become prune candidates (01 §5)
```

## 7. `diff_ref` Format

`01` §5 and `02` §3 leave `diff_ref`'s format unspecified.

**Decision**: `diff_ref` is a path into the Object Store — `/{workspace_id}/diffs/{version_id}.diff`
— containing a unified diff against the previous version, computed once and written by the Wiki
Service at the same time it writes the new `page_version` row. `pages/{id}/versions/diff` (`06`
§1) streams this stored blob rather than recomputing on every read — important for
frequently-viewed history on pages with many versions.

Alternative considered (compute-on-read from two `page_version.content` blobs): no extra storage,
but pays the diff cost on every `versions/diff` call, growing with version count. Write-once
avoids this at the cost of one small object per version.

**Spec touch-point**: `02` §1's Object Store row could add "page-version diffs" alongside what it
already stores; `02` §3's `diff_ref` could note its type as an object-store path.
