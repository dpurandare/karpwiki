# Enterprise Wiki Platform — Specification

A specification for an **Enterprise Wiki Platform** that adapts Andrej Karpathy's
[LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) — a small,
LLM-maintained knowledge base built from raw sources, a curated wiki, and a schema — into a
multi-workspace, horizontally scalable system for enterprise use.

## Background

- **Core idea**: raw sources → curated wiki → schema, with ingest / query / lint as the three
  operations (Karpathy's pattern).
- **Enterprise extensions**: multi-workspace partitioning by document type, a common gateway
  fronting all storage/indices/logs, async ingestion with human review, federated lexical search
  (no vector index), versioning/rollback, and dual API + MCP interfaces.

## Specification

The full specification lives in [`spec/`](spec/), as eight documents meant to be read in order:
