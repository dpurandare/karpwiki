# Enterprise Wiki Platform — Specification

A specification for an **Enterprise Wiki Platform** that adapts Andrej Karpathy's
[LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) — a small,
LLM-maintained knowledge base built from raw sources, a curated wiki, and a schema — into a
multi-workspace, horizontally scalable system for enterprise use.

## Background

### Karpathy Wiki for Agentic AI

Andrej Karpathy's original pattern is a small, LLM-maintained wiki meant to be read and kept
up to date by an AI agent rather than a human editor. This spec keeps that agent-first design
center: the dual API + MCP interfaces mean any agentic AI system can query the curated wiki or
submit new raw sources for ingestion directly, without a human in the loop.

- **Core idea**: raw sources → curated wiki → schema, with ingest / query / lint as the three
  operations (Karpathy's pattern).
- **Enterprise extensions**: multi-workspace partitioning by document type, a common gateway
  fronting all storage/indices/logs, async ingestion with human review, federated lexical search
  (no vector index), versioning/rollback, and dual API + MCP interfaces. As there is no reference implementation of Karpathy's wiki available, this is an attempt to define the detailed specifications for the implementation (and possible reference implementation).

The specification in [`spec/`](spec/) is written to be implementable as-is — it can be handed
to an engineering team (or an AI coding agent) to build directly.

## Research

Two similar open-source projects were analyzed for implementation ideas that fed into this
specification:

- [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) (Upstash) — a documentation retrieval MCP
  server/gateway.
- [GBrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) — a Postgres-native personal/team knowledge brain
  with hybrid (vector + BM25) search and a self-wiring knowledge graph.

The write-ups of those analyses are kept locally and are not published in this repository.

## Specification

The full specification lives in [`spec/`](spec/), as eight documents meant to be read in order:

| Doc | Title |
|---|---|
| [00](spec/00-overview.md) | Overview — purpose, design principles, scope, requirements traceability |
| [01](spec/01-architecture-and-data-model.md) | Architecture and Data Model |
| [02](spec/02-storage-and-indexing.md) | Storage and Indexing |
| [03](spec/03-ingestion-and-review-workflows.md) | Ingestion and Review Workflows |
| [04](spec/04-search-and-retrieval.md) | Search and Retrieval |
| [05](spec/05-admin-backend-and-maintenance.md) | Admin Backend and Maintenance |
| [06](spec/06-api-mcp-and-scaling.md) | API, MCP, and Scaling |
| [07](spec/07-additional-features-and-roadmap.md) | Additional Features and Roadmap |

Start with [`spec/00-overview.md`](spec/00-overview.md).

## Reference Implementation

[`spec/08-implementation-stack.md`](spec/08-implementation-stack.md) is an optional appendix
pinning a concrete Python stack (FastAPI, Celery, PostgreSQL, fsspec, Pydantic AI, etc.) to the
vendor-neutral roles defined in `00`–`07`. [`spec/09-implementation-notes.md`](spec/09-implementation-notes.md)
follows up with concrete design decisions for a handful of implementation-readiness gaps
(pipeline-state tracking, connector execution, MCP delegation, a `SCHEMA.md` example, `diff_ref`
format).
